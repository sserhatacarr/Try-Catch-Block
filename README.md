# Array Element Retriever

This simple Java program prompts the user to input an index. It then attempts to retrieve the element at the given index from a predefined array. If the index is valid, it displays the element. If the index is out of bounds, it catches an exception and displays an error message.

## Usage

1. Run the program with `java Main`.
2. Enter the index when prompted.

Make sure you have Java installed on your system to run this program.

Feel free to modify the array or integrate this functionality into your own Java application!
